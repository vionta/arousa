  <div class="body">
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Introduction</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Arousa is an example of dependency
      management on data/content transformation projects. It is aimed as a tool
      for managing dependencies between Xslts, XQuery, Xproc, scripts and
      related resources. It is also intended as an example for getting started
      with Apache Ivy on such kind of projects, that rely frequently on reusable
      steps and components.
      </p>

      <p class="p">Apache Ivy as a general purpose dependency
      management tool. It is used frequently with Apache Ant. Ant is a mature
      build tool appropriate for projects that need detail and flexibility. Ivy
      is an abstract dependency management framework, open to a wide range of
      use cases.</p>

      <p class="p">Arousa has two main parts: </p>

      <p class="p">1. A management
      Script that helps your create and update the project templates and
      configuration files.</p>

      <p class="p">2. A base (or set of base) template project
      with a pre-built Apache Ivy configuration. </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Why did I do it ?</h2>
      
      <p class="p">I think that Ivy adapts really well to
      transformation projects, where detail is key and every case
      may have some specific needs. Many of this tools are
      frequently handled with Ant.</p>

      <p class="p">I already had some small experience with Ivy, and was
      struggling with non DRY practices. So, I hope that this
      can be useful as a jump in aid or as a hint other people.
      Please use it and enjoy it.
      </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Quick Start.</h2>
      
      <div class="div">
	<p class="p">Installing the base script. </p>

	<p class="p">1. Dowload and unpack the Arousa zip distribution.</p>

	<p class="p">2. Set the
	AROUSA_HOME var on your system in a similar way to
	the JAVA_HOME,ANT_HOME, etc. Just set
	the AROUSA_HOME pointing to your installation.
	</p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  export AROUSA_HOME=&lt;Your_Installaton_path&gt;

	  export PATH=$PATH:$AROUSA_HOME
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">3. Navigate to a work folder and type:</p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  arousa 
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">If you can see the arousa command line help
	output you should be ready to start your first
	project. </p>

	<p class="p">Type:</p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  arousa template-project &lt;your-new-project-name&gt;
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">(you could also copy the template by hand and adjust
	name and configuration files).</p>

	<p class="p">At this point you should have created your
	first Arousa project with a build and configuration
	samples.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="div">
	<p class="p">Running your first project:</p>

	<p class="p">In your new project
	you can run the usual clean, build ant commands. You can
	adjust the build commands to suit your specific needs. </p>

	<p class="p">We are now going to start managing dependencies.
	Type one of the following commands
	</p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  arousa update-dependencies
	  ant arousa-update-dependencies
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">At this point you should notice
	that apache Ivy is downloading and a report on
	dependencies should also be showing. If everything
	looks ok, it's time to publish your first
	dependency.</p>

	<p class="p">Open the conf/arousa-ivy.xml and adjust name, path and
	version. Prepare the artifact for the build (adjust the
	name of the package and type </p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  ant package
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">At this point a zip file with your name and version should
	be in the dist folder. Type one of the following:</p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  ant dist 
	  ant arousa-publish-dependency
	  arousa publish-dependency
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">If everything is ok, you should have
	published your first dependency and your dist zip
	file should be in a subfolder of your ivy repository. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="div">
	<p class="p">Declaring dependencies</p>

	<p class="p">You will need to create a second
	dependency project and add your first
	project as a dependency.</p>

	<p class="p">Example:</p>

	<p class="p">----- Meter ejemplo -------------</p>
 
	<p class="p">Run one of the following:</p>

	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  ant arousa-update-dependencies
	</code></pre>
	<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	  arousa update-dependencies
	</code></pre>
	<p class="p">----Pendiente: Ejemplo de salida ------</p>

	<p class="p">Now take a look at the lib and deps
	folders. On the lib folder you should have your
	zip files. On the dep folder you should have your
	xslts, xprocs, ..etc. </p>

	<p class="p">On the build folder your static resources
	(css, img, svg, etc.) should also be placed.
	</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The dependencies/lib folder convention.</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Until now, what we have shown is 100% Ant/Ivy with
      nothing else added or strings attached. In order to
      differentiate dependency scripts from your current ones,
      and also in order to work on
      the next dependency chain step, we need
      to add some sort of folder naming convention.</p>

      <p class="p">We take source filesfrom </p>

      <p class="p">src/css</p>

      <p class="p">src/xslt</p>

      <p class="p">src/xproc </p>

      <p class="p">and so on.</p>

      <p class="p">We place (expanded) dependency files on </p>

      <p class="p">dep/xslt</p>

      <p class="p">dep/xproc</p>

      <p class="p">etc. </p>

      <p class="p">We avoid using the lib folder directly
      for the expanded files, since this is the default ivy folder and there is
      risk of collisions in file names. The zip files will be downloaded to the
      lib folder. It could be difficult to manage expanded and downloaded
      packages in the same location. </p>

      <p class="p">In order to refer to the dependendant script files,
      you should declare dependencies like the
      following example:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	....
	&lt;p:xslt name="tasks-average"&gt;
	  &lt;p:input port="stylesheet"&gt;
	    &lt;p:document href="../../deps/xsl/grouped-tasks-average.xsl"/&gt;
	  &lt;/p:input&gt;
	  &lt;p:input port="parameters"&gt;&lt;p:empty/&gt;&lt;/p:input&gt;
	&lt;/p:xslt&gt;
	...
      </code></pre>
      <p class="p">The above example shows a call to a dependency xslt script from and xproc file</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	...
	&lt;target name="build" &gt;
	  &lt;getodcontent odsfile="data/plan/Planificacion.ods" destfolder="temp" /&gt;
	  &lt;calabdoc src="./deps/xpl/extract-ods-tasks.xpl" doc="./temp/content.xml"  /&gt;
	&lt;/target&gt;
	...
      </code></pre>
      <p class="p">The above example shows a call to a dependency xproc script from and ant
      build file</p>

      
      <p class="p">You can refer your dependencies from the same folder in the
      following way. </p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
	&lt;xsl:stylesheet
	    version="3.0"
	    xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	    xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
	    &gt;

	    &lt;xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes" &gt;&lt;/xsl:output&gt;
	    &lt;xsl:import href="planning-elements.xsl" /&gt;
	    ...
	    &lt;xsl:template match="@*"&gt;
	      ....
	    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
	    ...
	&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
      </code></pre>
      
      <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
      &lt;p:declare-step name="extract-tasks"
		      xmlns:p="http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc"
		      xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
		      version="1.0"
		      &gt;
	....
        &lt;p:xslt name="empty-cells"&gt;
	  &lt;p:with-input
	    port="stylesheet"
	      href="../xsl/process-empty-cells.xsl"/&gt;
        &lt;/p:xslt&gt;
	....
      &lt;/p:declare-step&gt;
      </code></pre>
      
      <p class="p">This is the only convention added by the tool/scrip/example. What you get is 100%
      compatible Ant/Ivy projects apart from that. You can run the projects with
      Ant on a computer without the Arousa Script without problems, ...
      hopefully... .</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tailoring Arousa.</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Arousa is a generic example for data/content transformation and
      dependency management. </p>

      <p class="p">This kind of projects need a great level of detail and
      adjustment/flexibility.</p>

      <p class="p">You can adjust the solution by modifying the Ant task in the build and
      conf/arousa-build.xml files. You can do it in one specific project or add
      a modified template to the tool. </p>

      <p class="p">The configuration Scripts</p>

      <p class="p">The Arousa template project is based on the following set of scripts.
      </p>

      <p class="p">/build.xml </p>

      <p class="p">This is the generic/usual Ant build file with
      the usual clean, build, package tasks. </p>

      <p class="p">conf/arousa-build.xml </p>

      <p class="p">The base Arousa script with the targets that handle dependency
      publishing and retrieving. </p>

      <p class="p">conf/arousa-ivy.xml</p>

      <p class="p">The project publications and dependencies. Despite its name,
      this is a regular ivy.xml file.</p>

      <p class="p">conf/arousa-config.xml</p>

      <p class="p">This file configures the repositories location, chain, etc.
      It is also an Ivy regular configuration file. </p>

      <p class="p">Where can I get more information </p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Requirements</h2>
      
      <ol class="ol">
	<li class="li">Ant installation and some basic knowledge. Since all the solution is
	based on Apache Ant, some knowledge is needed. A working Apache Ant
	installation is needed.</li>

	<li class="li">
	  <p class="p">Bash or Cygwin.</p>

	  <p class="p">The Arousa script has been only tested on a bash environment based on
	  Cygwin. There are lots of aspects that need testing on different systems.
	  Also, the script may be ported to windows .bat file.</p>


	  <p class="p">Even if your system does not support the script you can copy and paste
	  the template by hand and use them with pure Ant.</p>


	  <p class="p">The ant parts should work in different environments with small or no
	  adjustment.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuration</h2>
      

      <p class="p">The directory structure convention</p>


      <p class="p">In order to maintain a clean distribution we needed to adopt a folder
      convention. We also needed to adopt a naming schema that (kind of)
      transparently integrate the dependency references both from the current
      project and the next ones.</p>


      <p class="p">We use a two level folder configuration.</p>


      <p class="p">&lt;your-project&gt;/src/xsl</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Tools and Aknoledgements</h2>
      

      <p class="p">Apache Ant. The scripts are based on the mature/popular build tool.</p>


      <p class="p">Apache Ivy. Basically, this tool/script is an example of an Apache Ivy
      configuration.</p>


      <p class="p">Saxon/Saxonica. More or less needed for everything, Xslts and all the
      transformation tools that deppend on it.</p>


      <p class="p">Morgana XProc/Calabash. Althought we don't provide xproc implementation
      XProc projects will require one of them and some ant script adjustment.</p>
